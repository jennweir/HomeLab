      # Secret resource that will be used to store the account's private key.
      # This is your identity with your ACME provider. Any secret name may be
      # chosen. It will be populated with data automatically, so generally
      # nothing further needs to be done with the secret. If you lose this
      # identity/secret, you will be able to generate a new one and generate
      # certificates for any/all domains managed using your previous account,
      # but you will be unable to revoke any certificates generated using that
      # previous account.
